# CD Sync

This is an old hobby project of mine that I did in 2009-10. I'm releasing the source code under GPLv3.

Many antique technologies used: Access Database files (.mdb), .Net Framework 2.0, Windows Registry, CHM files for documentation etc.

CD Sync Portable is a disc cataloging software that allows you to catalog your CDs/DVDs/Flash Drives/Hard drive Folders etc. With CD Sync Portable, you get the ability to browse and search your data, even when the source media is not available.
